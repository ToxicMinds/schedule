# RecompOS — CLAUDE.md

**This repo is RecompOS.** A personal body-recomposition app: weight, food, training,
recovery, alarms. Svelte 5 + SvelteKit PWA, Supabase backend, shipped to Android as a
thin Capacitor shell.

It is **not** Synculariti. Synculariti (`/home/nik/synculariti-core`) is a restaurant
inventory-management monorepo — NestJS + Next.js + pnpm/Turborepo, Neo4j, Gemini invoice
extraction, Render/Railway deploys. Nothing in that repo applies here and nothing here
applies there. If a task mentions invoices, tenants, IMS, or `apps/ims/api`, you are in
the wrong directory.

| | RecompOS (here) | Synculariti |
|---|---|---|
| Path | `/home/nik/schedule` | `/home/nik/synculariti-core` |
| Repo | `ToxicMinds/schedule` (**public**) | private |
| Stack | SvelteKit 5 PWA + Capacitor Android | NestJS + Next.js, pnpm monorepo |
| Data | Supabase `jerbhsasccvjelkkphgu` | its own Supabase + Neo4j |
| Hosting | Vercel `svelte-recomp`, account `nikibmacc-2092` | Render |
| Secrets | `~/.config/recompos/*.env` | `.env.local` in that repo |

## Credentials — all three are already stored. Never ask for them again.

| Service | Where | Load it |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | `gh` CLI, OS keyring, account `ToxicMinds` | already active — just use `gh` |
| Vercel | `~/.config/recompos/vercel.env` (mode 600) | `set -a; . ~/.config/recompos/vercel.env; set +a` |
| Supabase | `~/.config/recompos/supabase.env` (mode 600) | `set -a; . ~/.config/recompos/supabase.env; set +a` |

`~/.config/recompos/` is the wall: it holds RecompOS credentials and nothing else, it is
outside the repo, and it is mode 600. **Secrets never go in this file, in the memory
directory, or anywhere under the repo** — `ToxicMinds/schedule` is a public repo.

Verify access without printing values:
```sh
gh auth status
set -a; . ~/.config/recompos/vercel.env;   set +a; vercel whoami --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"
set -a; . ~/.config/recompos/supabase.env; set +a; \
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/$SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF"   # expect 200
```

## Layout

`svelte-recomp/` is the live app. The repo root also carries an older vanilla JS version
(`index.html`, `js/`, `css/`) and `watch-bridge/` — **neither is what ships.** Don't edit
them thinking you're fixing the app.

## Ship model

The APK is a thin shell: `svelte-recomp/capacitor.config.json` sets `server.url` to the
live Vercel site, so the installed app loads the same build a browser does.

- **Web / UI / logic change** → deploy to Vercel. Installed apps pick it up on next
  launch. No reinstall, no APK.
- **Native change** (`AndroidManifest.xml`, Capacitor plugins, `capacitor.config.json`,
  launcher icons) → the APK must be rebuilt and installed. Pushing anything under
  `svelte-recomp/android/**` triggers `.github/workflows/build-app-apk.yml`, which
  publishes to the `recompos-app-latest` GitHub release.

Since `1774240` every APK is signed with the committed `recompos.keystore`, so installs
are true in-place updates — data and login survive. `ApkInstallerPlugin` gives a one-tap
in-app update.

## Deploy

```sh
cd /home/nik/schedule/svelte-recomp
set -a; . ~/.config/recompos/vercel.env; set +a
vercel --prod --yes --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"
```

- **Never add a Vercel↔GitHub integration.** The absence of webhooks is deliberate.
  Don't offer one again.
- Use `/usr/local/bin/vercel`. `npx vercel` fails here (Node 25 vs the CLI engine range).
- Quote `"$VERCEL_TOKEN"` — unquoted trips the CLI's "contents are invalid" check.
- The live app is **`svelte-recomp.vercel.app`**. `recompos.vercel.app` is a different,
  older project on the same account; checking it after a deploy shows stale HTML and
  looks like a failure.
- Verify: `curl -sI https://svelte-recomp.vercel.app/ | grep -i '^age'`. A large `age`
  means the deploy didn't land.
- The `vercel` MCP tools are authed to a different account and cannot see this project.
  Same for the `supabase-prod` / `supabase-staging` MCP servers — they point at other
  refs. Never run RecompOS migrations through them.

## Before you commit

```sh
cd svelte-recomp && node scripts/selfcheck.js && npm run build
```

`selfcheck.js` is the whole test suite (~140 assertions, no framework). It must print
**All checks passed.** Async checks only report because of `await Promise.all(pending)`
at the end — if you ever see that line go missing, every file-reading check is passing
vacuously and the suite is lying to you.

## Data isolation — read before adding a table

`stores/sync.ts` calls `supabase.from(table).select('*')` with **no `user_id` filter**.
Isolation rests entirely on RLS. Any new table must have RLS enabled and the four
`own_rows_*` policies **before** it joins the `TABLES` list, or it leaks every user's
rows into every user's local Dexie. Follow `20260727120000_recipes_custom.sql`.

Audited 2026-07-28 against a real second account: reads returned 0 rows, cross-user
insert rejected `42501`, cross-user update/delete affected 0 rows.

## Supabase notes

Project ref `jerbhsasccvjelkkphgu`. The anon and service_role JWTs authenticate data
calls only — service_role gets **401 from `api.supabase.com`** and cannot run migrations
or deploy functions. Only the `sbp_…` personal access token can. Edge functions must live
under the **root** `supabase/functions/` to deploy; `svelte-recomp/supabase/functions/` is
the source copy.
