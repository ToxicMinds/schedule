//
// "18:00 — Weigh-in" is a clock. "You're 40 g of protein short and it's 8pm" is
// a coach. The app already computes everything needed for the second kind — it
// just had no way to say it at the moment it would matter, because a phone in a
// pocket runs none of this code.
//
// The trick is that state in this app ONLY changes through the app: food, sets
// and weight are all typed in. So evaluating the day whenever the app is open,
// and (re)scheduling one-shot OS notifications for later today, is enough — by
// the time a nudge fires, nothing can have silently invalidated it except the
// user opening the app again, which re-evaluates and cancels it.
//
// Pure and unit-tested. The OS half lives in nativeAlarms.ts.
