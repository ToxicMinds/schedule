// retype them every single visit, and nothing else in the app could ever see
// them. So the TDEE engine, which needs all three, could not run unless you were
// currently sitting on that one screen filling the form in again.

// Everything personal now lives in one record, entered once. Age is stored as a
// BIRTH YEAR rather than a number of years, because an age silently becomes
// wrong and a birth year never does.
