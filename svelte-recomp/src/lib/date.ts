// Local-calendar date helpers.
//
// THE BUG THIS FIXES: the app used `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` in
// fifteen places to mean "today". That is the UTC date, not the local one — so
// anywhere east of Greenwich, every log written between local midnight and the
// UTC offset (05:30 in India, 01:00 in British summer time) was filed under
// YESTERDAY. Meanwhile the Health Connect sync always wrote the LOCAL date, so
// the watch's steps and the morning's food landed on different rows: today's
// calories looked empty, yesterday's looked double, and the adaptive-TDEE
// window fitted intake against weights that were off by a day.
//
// Every "what day is it" question in the app goes through here now, so the
// answer is the same everywhere.
