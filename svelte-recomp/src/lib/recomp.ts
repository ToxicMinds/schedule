// The recomposition verdict.
//
// This answers the only question the whole app exists to answer: **is the
// weight coming off fat, or muscle?** Every other screen shows an input —
// calories, sets, steps, sleep. None of them told you whether the plan is
// actually working, even though the data to say so was already in the database.
//
// Two independent lines of evidence, in order of strength:
//
//   1. MEASURED composition. If body-fat percentage has been logged at least
//      twice, lean mass = weight × (1 − bf/100) is directly computable, and the
//      split of the weight change into fat vs lean follows. Nothing beats this.
//   2. INFERRED composition. Otherwise, pair the weight trend with the lift
//      log: strength holding or climbing while weight falls is the accepted
//      practical proxy for muscle retention, because a muscle that is being
//      lost does not keep producing the same force.
//
// The rule the verdict is built on: in a well-run deficit, roughly 75%+ of the
// weight lost should be fat. Lose much more lean than that and the cut is too
// aggressive, protein is too low, or the training stimulus is missing.
//
// Pure — no Svelte, Dexie or Capacitor — so it is unit-tested in selfcheck.js.
