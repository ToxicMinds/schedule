// THE WEEK ASKS BACK.
//
// Everything else in this app measures. The scale, the watch, the food log and
// the barbell all report numbers, and weeklyReview.ts turns them into a digest.
// But none of them can read the one signal that decides whether a plan survives:
// how it actually felt. A cut that is working on paper and leaving you starving
// at 10pm every night is a cut you will quit in three weeks, and no sensor in
// the world will say so.
//
// So once a week the app stops talking and asks three questions. The answers are
// not a diary entry — they change next week's numbers, combined with what was
// measured. That combination is the whole point: "I was starving" means one
// thing when the scale is falling 1.4%/week and something completely different
// when it hasn't moved at all.
//
// Pure and unit-tested; no Svelte, no Dexie. Stored as jsonb on daily_logs
// (keyed by the week's Monday), so it inherits that table's existing RLS rather
// than adding a new table to the sync surface.
