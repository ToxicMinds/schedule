// Watch / wearable brand registry.
//
// THE KEY INSIGHT: on Android, Health Connect is the universal layer. Every
// brand's companion app (Samsung Health, Garmin Connect, OHealth, Fitbit…)
// mirrors the watch's data into the same store, and this app reads that store.
// So integration is ALREADY brand-agnostic — nothing per-brand is needed to read
// the data itself.
//
// What genuinely does differ, and what this file exists for:
//
//   1. THE PACKAGE NAME. De-duplication has to know which source is the watch
//      and which is the phone (see dedupe.ts). The old detection was a regex
//      that listed OnePlus, Garmin, Fitbit and others but NOT Samsung — so a
//      Galaxy Watch user fell through to "whichever source logged more", which
//      can silently pick the phone's step counter over the watch.
//   2. THE SETUP. Every companion app hides the Health Connect switch somewhere
//      different, and several ship with it OFF by default. "It's not working"
//      is nearly always this, and the fix is a brand-specific instruction.
//   3. WHAT EACH BRAND ACTUALLY WRITES. Some export sleep stages, some only
//      total sleep; some never export HRV. Promising a signal the hardware
//      won't provide is worse than saying so up front.
//
// Menu paths drift between app versions, so the steps are written as guidance
// rather than exact taps.
