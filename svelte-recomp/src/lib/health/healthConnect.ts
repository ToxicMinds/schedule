/**
 * Health Connect integration (native Android only).
 *
 * When RecompOS runs inside its Capacitor Android shell, this reads the
 * OnePlus Watch data that OHealth mirrors into Health Connect (steps, sleep,
 * resting heart rate, HRV) and writes it into the app's own `steps` and
 * `biometrics` tables. That makes the Daily Readiness card and step stats
 * light up with real watch data using the exact same data path as manual entry.
 *
 * In a normal browser (the PWA / desktop) everything here no-ops, so the web
