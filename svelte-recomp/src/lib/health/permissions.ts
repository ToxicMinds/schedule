/**
 * Health Connect record types + their Android read-permission strings.
 *
 * Kept in a pure module (no Dexie/Capacitor imports) so the crash-critical
 * invariant is unit-testable: the native plugin's readRecords() runs in an
 * UNGUARDED coroutine, so calling it for a record type whose permission is not
 * granted throws a SecurityException that escapes the coroutine and
 * HARD-CRASHES the app (it never rejects the JS promise). We must therefore
 * only ever read the types the user actually granted — `grantedReadTypes`
 * computes exactly that from Health Connect's granted-permission list.
 *
 * Keep READ_PERMISSION in sync with android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.

 * the new types were NEVER requested — and since we (correctly) refuse to read
 * ungranted types, watch workouts silently returned nothing forever.
