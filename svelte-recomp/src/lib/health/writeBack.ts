// THE WATCH STOPS BEING A ONE-WAY STREET.
//
// Health Connect has always fed this app: steps, sleep, heart rate, watch-logged
// workouts. Nothing ever went the other way. A session you logged by hand here —
// the whole point of the "watch missed one" flow — existed in RecompOS and
// nowhere else, so your own workout history disagreed with itself depending on
// which app you opened. Same for a weigh-in typed into Progress.
//
// This writes those two things back, and only those two: things the user
// explicitly entered, that no sensor produced. Nothing derived, nothing
// estimated — publishing a computed number into the platform record would
// pollute every other app that reads it.
//
// SAFETY: the plugin's insertRecords() runs in an UNGUARDED Kotlin coroutine,
// exactly like readRecords(). Writing a type whose permission was refused throws
// a SecurityException that escapes the coroutine and HARD-CRASHES the app rather
// than rejecting the promise. Every write here is gated on canWrite() first.
