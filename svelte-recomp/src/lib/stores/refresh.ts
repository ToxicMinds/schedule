// One "refresh everything" entry point, plus the clock that time-derived
// screens depend on.
//
// TWO PROBLEMS THIS SOLVES:
//
// 1. There was no single refresh. The Readiness card had a "Sync" button that
//    pulled Health Connect only; Supabase data relied on a realtime socket that
//    silently goes stale when the phone sleeps or loses signal; and nothing at
//    all re-read the clock. As an installed app rather than a browser tab, there
//    is no reload to fall back on — so "pull down to get the truth" has to be a
//    real, complete operation.
//
// 2. Recovery percentages froze. Muscle recovery, "3h ago", ACWR windows and
//    the coach's time-of-day advice are all computed from Date.now() inside
//    $derived blocks. A $derived only recomputes when a REACTIVE dependency
//    changes, and Date.now() is not reactive — so an app left open overnight
//    kept insisting a muscle needed 14 more hours, forever. `nowTick` is that
//    missing dependency: read it in any time-based $derived and the value moves
//    on a timer and on every manual refresh.
