-- Recover height/sex/start weight for users who predate the profile columns.
--
-- THE PROBLEM: height and sex were never persisted anywhere. They lived as local
-- component state inside BodyGoals.svelte and were retyped on every visit, so
-- when user_settings gained real profile columns there was nothing to migrate
-- them from — and every existing user was therefore treated as brand new and
-- pushed into first-run onboarding, which looks exactly like "my data is gone".
--
-- But the values DO survive, in prose. The "Set as my goal" flow wrote a
-- goal_reason narrative that embeds them verbatim, e.g.:
--
--   "...at 111.1kg, 187cm, 41yo male, moderately active..."
--
-- So we parse them back out. Only fills columns that are still NULL, so anyone
-- who has since entered real values is untouched.

-- Height: the "187cm" in the narrative.

   -- Mifflin-St Jeor, which would silently produce a wrong calorie target
   -- rather than failing loudly.
